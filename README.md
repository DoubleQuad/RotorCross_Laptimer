# RotorCross_Laptimer
Eventually this will be paired with an Arduino lap timing system.

Currently this is a proof on concept project, to get the primary modules of a lap timing system into a web page.
Eventually I will endeavour to partner this with an Arduino based lap timing system, and also an LED block.
